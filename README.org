* Gravie Challenge
  This is the Gravie Challenge Test
  
  You need to have this tools installed to build the app
  - npm
  - clojure

* Installed on localhost
  To get the app clone the git repository
  #+begin_src shell :eval false
  git clone https://github.com/gmsvalente/gravie.git
  #+end_src

  On the root of the repository run
  #+begin_src shell :eval false
  npm install
  clojure -M:shadow:shadow-release
  #+end_src
  It will install the npm dependencies and build the main.js from shadow-cljs

  To run the application you need to specify a server port or it will use port 8080
  You need also an api-key from [[giantbomb.com/api]]

  #+begin_src shell :eval false
  export PORT=<port number>
  export GIANTBOMB_API=<your api-key>
  clojure -M:server
  #+end_src

* Using docker
  You can create a docker image. You need docker installed local
  Clone the repository and on the root directory
  #+begin_src shell :eval false
  docker build -t <build-name> .
  #+end_src

  Where <build-name> is the name of the image created then run it in a container
  #+begin_src shell :eval false
  docker run --name <container-name> -e "PORT=<port>" -e "GIANTBOMB_API=<api-key>" -p <local-port>:<port> <build-name>
  #+end_src


* Things I wish i have done
  - TESTS! TDD could really improve the production
  - Used a database like postgres or even datomic or XTDB
